	Keep America out of last-ditch war
	
	8 years ago, American industry grinding to a stop
		-whole banking system ceased to function
		
		-tried to convey to the people, what this meant in terms of their daily lives
			farmers, widows, elderly, mill workers and factory workers
	
		-tonight, goal is the same, convey to the people in terms of daily lives
		
	New -Crisis
		security of our Nation
		-greatest danger since Jamestown and Plymouth Rock
		
		Treaty signed in Berlin
			-Axis powers
			-two Europe countries
			-one Asian
			-attack if US interferes with their expansion mission for global control
			
		Nazis
			-dominate all life throughout their country
			-enslave all of Europe
			-dominate rest of world
			-"There are two worlds that stand opposed to each other. 
			Others are correct when they say: 
			With this world we cannot every reconcile ourselves... 
			I can beat any other power in the world"
			-there can be no ultimate peace between their philosophy of government and ours
			-US is not going to offer peace because of this proclaim, no point until aggressor abandons talk of world domination
		
	Forces status
		Germans and Italians blocked by British and Greek in Atlantic
		Japanese engaged by Chinese
		Our fleet is in the Pacific
		
	Wars between Europe and Asia do effect us
		they must not gain control of the oceans which lead to the Western Hemisphere
		Monroe Doctrine 
			- measure of defense against in face of threat from Contnental Europe
			- afterwards, no treaty
			- afterwatds, no unspoken agreement
			
	If Great Britian goes down
		- Axis powers will be our neighbors
		- control of Europe, Asia, Africa, Austrailia and the high seas
		- world would be run by brute force
		
	Distance
		- not a factor
		
	Public
		- majority wants truth
		- minority wants to see no evil, hear no evil

	Nazi actions
		- some nations in Europe had solemn non-intervention pacts, they were invaded anyway
		- some invasion notices arrived up to 2 hours after the invasion started
		- Nazi's claim they are "restoring peace", or "protecting the country from other invasion threats"
		- Occupying Belgium to save from British
		- Belgium is now used as an invasion base against British
		- Any South American country would be the same gateway to the US
		- Examples of Ireland and Azores being snuffed out because they are free
		- Western Hemisphere has most tempting loot
		
	Secret emissaries
		- stir up suspicion and dissension to cause internal strife
		- try to turn capital against labor and vice versa
		- try to awake long slumbering racial and religious enmitites
		- try to promote intolerance
		- goal: divide our people into hostile groups to destroy our unity
		
	Americans in high places
		- want to close their eyes to the war overseas
		- want to join Nazi's to appease
		- no man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it
		- nation can only have peace with Nazi after price of total surrender
		- examples, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlads, Denmark and France
		- they say Axis powers will win anyway, so all this bloodshed could be saved
		- they say we should aim for negotiated peace
		- Nonesense! Is it negotiated peace if a gang of outlaws surrounds your community and on threat of exterminantion makes you pay tribute?
	
	New Order
		- background of concentration camp
		- Gods servants in chains
		- unholy alliance of power and pelf to dominate and enslave the human race
		
	US Policy
		- Europe is not asking us to do their fighting
		- they ask us for implements of war
		- Government does not have an expectation of sending an American Expeditionary Force outside of the US
		- sole purpose of our Govt is to keep us out of war
		- based on advice from military and naval experts who have the defense of the US in their mind
		- Government expects that workers will be as productive as possible
			- no labor strikes or lock-outs
			- resolve internal conflicts
		- defense must not be blocked by those who fear the future
		- the purpose of the nation is to build with all possible speed every machince, arsenal and factory that we need to manufacture our defense
		- no "bottlenecks" in our aid to Great Britian, even under threat of a dictator
		- no excuse for "defeatism" because there is every reason for hope
		- our common cause will succeed
