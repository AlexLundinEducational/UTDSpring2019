	does not want to limit himself to democratic partisian view
	
	WWI
		150,000 trained troops
		regular navy
		aid of allies
		great plan, built bottom up
	
	more grave emergency today
	
	Napoleon lost battle of waterloo
		he forgot his infantry in favor of cavalry
		our current admin has forgotten our economic infantry
	
	build a new plan
		from bottom up of economic pyramid
		faith once more, in the forgotten man at the bottom
		
	Essentials of the plan
		economic magic will not work
			spending huge funds to solve unemployment
			even billions of dollar would to give employement to then 7-10 million people out of a job
		cure must go to killing economic bacteria in the system
		
	1/2 of population earns living off farming
		farmers lost their purchasing power
			due to cost to grow exceeding revenue from their harvest
		farming industry lost ability to sell machines to them
		
		no nation can long endure half bankrupt
			main Street, Broadway, the mills and the mines will close
		
		1] MUST RESTORE purchasing power to the farming half
			without this, wheels of railroads and factories will not turn
	
	housing
		2] KEEP home-owner and farm-owner where they are, without foreclosure
			by government giving money to small banks, as much as they give to big banks
		
		big banks don't have a close connection to farmers
		little banks often don't want to evict, but they have not much choice
		
	tarrif policy
		based on common sense, not hot-air and profiteering
			high tarrifs are killing international trade
			1/2 of what it was 4 years prior
			
		this allows other nations, without cash, to trade with us
	
		3] revise tariff on reciprocal exchange of goods
		
	these are only 3 of the 10 to 12 factors
		they seem to be beyond the concern of a national administration that can only think from the top down
			-total failed to plan in a comprehensive way
			-waited until something cracked then at the last moment sought to prevent collapse
			
	high time to get back to fundamentals
		must admit with courage we are in emergency equal to a war
		must mobilize to meet it
