Structural differentiation
	in modern societies, small groups decrease and are replaced by big ones
	
joiner instinct
reaching goals
	desire for collective good
	desire for most efficient means of getting there
6
social incentives
	prestige
	respect
	friendship
	social and psychological objectives
	used in previledged groups
	used to mobilize a latent group, but there is no indication that this will drive toward a collective good in large groups
	this is really most effective with small groups, face to face contact
	
7
federal group	
	latent group, divided into small sub groups
	central organziation provides some service to each small group
		through this, social incentives are effective at rewarding individuals to contribute to collective goals
11-13
	knowledge of the tragedy of the commons
		the commons are the areas we all share
			in the past, farmers could continue to add more heads of cattle
			overgrazzing was such a minor issue compared to the larger benefit of more animals
			eventually farming reached critical mass, at some point
			now it is no longer acceptable to blinding accumulate
			the commons apply to many aspects of the world
			we are continuing to abbandon free sharing, and move toward systematic structure in many areas, as a matter of survival as a species
		what to maximize?
			goods
			population

Chapter 2
32
	intro to american constitution
		intro to praise
		intro to criticisms
	general criticisms	
		unstable gov
		public good takes a backseat to conflicts of rival parties
		measures are decided by majority force, instead of rules and rights of the minority party
33
	solutions to general criticisms
		remove causes
		control effects
		
	removing causes	
		eliminate liberty
		standardize everyones passions, interesting and opinions
34
	reached conclusion that CAUSES of faction cannot be removed, relief is only sought through controlling EFFECTS
	
	controlling effects	
		existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented
		the majority must be rendered unable to create schemes of oppression
		
	failings of pure demoncracy
		there is always a tendency to oppress the minority, even in beniegn systems
		this is due to pure demoncracies not having checks in place

35
	benefits of republic
	size of elected representatives compared to nation goverened
36
	republic solves issue of pure democracy
		republic can CONTROL effects of faction
37
	federalist papers
		Madision recoomends structure for governement
			seperation of powers 
				(checks and balances)
			serperation of election of members in each sector 
				(public elects through channels, and the avenues are not intertwined)
			seperation of appointment of members within the sector, from senior members	
				this is subject to modification 
					(because Judges for example must have work experience, and only senior judges can know how to tell)
					(the Senior judges are required to set up a system that removes the dependecy as soon as possible, after hiring)
38
	federalist papers
		cont.
			1 enable govt to control governed
			2 oblige govt to control itself
			
		examples of solutions to unequal powers
			1 self-defense
				divide legislature into different branches
				render branches disconnected with different elections and principles of action
				
		Madisions proof of just principles	
			he summizes his principles are just
			if a govt does not perfectly correspond with the framework, it will be less able to be just
39
	federal papers	
		two principles of interest
			1 all the power surrendered by the people is given to the administration
				usurpations gaurded by govt branch
				the branch is sub divided 
				further seperation is a double security for the people, which is a good thing
				the branches will control each other, at the same time each will control itself
				
			2 republic must gaurd society againt oppression of rules AND guard one part of society against influence from the other part of society
				- create will in the community, independent of the majority
					one example is heredity or self-appointed authority
					another is a federal republic, all power from citizens, who will by nature, be divides into many different categories, not only a majority
		
		justice is the end of govt
			it must be pursed until it is reached
			otherwise liberty is lost along the way

	REPUBLICAN CAUSE and mixture of the FEDERAL PRINCIPLE
41
	McCulloch V Maryland
		does congress have the power to create a federal bank?
		does Maryland have the authority to tax a federal bank if Congress has the power to create one?
		
42
	
43
	Goverment
		limited in powers
		supreme law of land
			despite anything in the Constitution or laws of and State that are contrary
		binds states together
44
	build up of proof for why Government must be able to
		aquire resources, to execute plans, to ensure nations well being
45
	breakdown of necessary and proper clause
46
	McCulloch vs Maryland
		incorporated the Bank of the United States

47
	Can the state of Maryland, tax that branch without violating the constitution?
		taxation is retained by states
		can the states, exercise their sovereign powers on Congress by taxing the bank?
		seemly unlikely, since the banks funds directly effect the entire nation, so no one state should control those means
		if the states are allowed to tax one instrument of Congress, then they can tax any or all instruments of Congress
		the power to tax is the power to destroy, and render useless the power to create	
48
	seems like the law passed by Maryland, imposing a tax on the Bank of the US is unconstitutional
	
49
