social incentives
	prestige
	respect
	friendship
	social and psychological objectives
	used in previledged groups

federal group	
	latent group, divided into small sub groups
	central organziation provides some service to each small group
		through this, social incentives are effective at rewarding individuals to contribute to collective goals

	knowledge of the tragedy of the commons
		the commons are the areas we all share
			in the past, farmers could continue to add more heads of cattle
			overgrazzing was such a minor issue compared to the larger benefit of more animals
			eventually farming reached critical mass, at some point
			now it is no longer acceptable to blinding accumulate
			the commons apply to many aspects of the world
			we are continuing to abbandon free sharing, and move toward systematic structure in many areas, as a matter of survival as a species
		what to maximize?
			goods
			population
